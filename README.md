This project is from Udemy course [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

## What is all about. 

This is a simple react project for testing the youtube api. It doesnt have a huge amount of state management so it is now using redux. You can see a simple and basic modules structure and two main states, is not a big deal. 

##Technologies. 

I am using Semantic for theming, (I didnt touch a line of css, so dont expect too much.) with the [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) the official Semantic-UI-React integration. 

For services it is connected with the youtube api search. There is a couple lines with Axios. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
